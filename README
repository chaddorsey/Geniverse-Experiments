This is a test of a Comet server set up using streamhub. When this directory is viewed in a Web browser, it should display a BioLogica applet.
When the streamhub Comet server is launched, it will run a Comet server on port 7878 and enable chat across multiple browsers.
To launch the Comet server, run the following command within the Comet-streamhub directory:
java -cp json-20080701.jar:log4j-1.2.14.jar:streamhub-2.0.11.jar:. Chat
More information about this is available at http://streamhub.blogspot.com/2009/07/tutorial-building-comet-chat.html and http://streamhub.blogspot.com/2009/10/getting-started-with-reverse-ajax-and.html.

There is also information about setting up a Streamhub server sharing port 80 with an HTTP connection on a single IP address at http://iamseanmurphy.com/2009/03/02/high-performance-comet-on-a-shoestring/

To compile the server (needed for configuration for some crazy reason):

avac -cp streamhub-2.0.11.jar Chat.java
