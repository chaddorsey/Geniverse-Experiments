This is a test of a Comet server set up using streamhub. 

When this directory is viewed in a Web browser, it should display a BioLogica applet.

When the streamhub Comet server is launched, it will run a Comet server on port 7878 and enable chat across multiple browsers.

First compile the server Chat.java to produce Chat.class:

  javac -cp streamhub-2.0.11.jar Chat.java

To launch the Comet server, and run the Chat class run the following command:

  cd Comet-streamhub
  java -cp json-20080701.jar:log4j-1.2.14.jar:streamhub-2.0.11.jar:. Chat

There is also information about setting up a Streamhub server sharing port 80 
with an HTTP connection on a single IP address:

NOTE: To configure your Comet chat server location in index.html and gvdemo.html, you will need to add an untracked file chat-server.js into the same directory as these two files. This file should contain a variable declaration indicating the location of your Comet chat server. This commonly looks something like this (one-line file):

  var chatserver = "http://localhost:7878/"; 

This can be done easily with the following console command:

  $ echo 'var chatserver = "http://localhost:7878/";' > chat-server.js
