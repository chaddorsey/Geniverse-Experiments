Logging
=======

StreamHub uses Log4J to handle its logging.  
It looks for a configuration file called conf/log4j.xml.

To turn on debug logging, copy/rename log4j-debug.xml 
to log4j.xml.  You can always revert back to the 
original configuration in log4j-default.xml.

To learn more about configuring Log4J refer to 
the website here:

And this guide on XML configuration:
